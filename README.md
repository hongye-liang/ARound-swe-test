# SWE INTERVIEW TEST Solution


1. First download or access the files.
2. Then open two terminals and navigate to the file, one switch directory to the directory named 'backend' and one switch to 'frontend'
3. Once in the 'backend' directory run command 'npm install' to get all the packages. And then run the command 'npm start' to start the backend. You will see 'Server is running on port 5000' showing on the screen. That means the backend part of the applications is working nicely.
4. Then find the terminal with 'frontend' directory and repeat the same process from step 4. 
5. Once everything is done, default browser will appear and brings you to [local](http://localhost:3000/) which is where the application runs.
